From Wikipedia:
"Gator Panic, known as Wacky Gator in the US and Wani Wani Panic (????????) in Japan, is a redemption arcade game released in 1988 by Namco. The game plays very much like Whac-A-Mole, but features alligators coming out of the cabinet horizontally instead of moles coming out vertically. The game was named Wacky Gator for North America and featured a different cabinet design."

___________________________________________________________


The main differences between Gator Panic and Whac-A-Mole are:

1: Layout. Gator panic is 5 horizontal lanes, Whacamole is 5 vertical lanes in a W pattern.

2: Creature behavior. Gators extend a variable length, at a variable speed, then retreat at that same extend speed. Moles pop up at a fixed speed, and remain fully-extended for a gradually-decreasing amount of time.

3: Scoring. In gator panic, the player receives a bite if they react too slowly AND if that gator extends far enough to reach the bite zone (extension length is random). Bites negatively impact score. A retreating gator can still be hit for normal points, regardless of whether or not it bit the player. Gator hits always reward a fixed number of points. In whacamole, there is no penalty for misses, but the faster you react, the more points you get for that hit.

4: Phases. Whacamole features a single phase and gradually accellerates over the playtime. Multiple moles can extend as soon as the first tick, and extend simultaneously. Gator panic features 7 phases, each with a fixed number of simultaneous gators, and a fixed period between them. See "Gameplay Timeline" in reference photos for full breakdown.

Whack'em Funky Gators (2016)

The most recent "remake" of the game, released in 2016 by BANDAI NAMCO Amusement America, features none of the original sounds, music, interface, or cabinet art as the original. The original was made by the now-defunct NAMCO (as of 2006). Many additional new features were added to "Whack'em Funky Gators", including multi-lane, multi-hit gators, bonus gators, different color and patterns, and a few others:

This complete overhaul could have been done to avoid copyright, or simply because they wanted to modernize the game as well as the interface.

A mobile app "inspired by" the original was made by Asantee Games, and was available for free on the App Store. Rather than a timed game, the app features a 3-health system for bites, and occasionally spawns hearts which can be hit to refill 1 health point. As far as I can tell, no copyright issues have befallen them. 


Smacky Crocs (2020)

Our game is going to do the following things to avoid legal issues:

1) The sound effects will be remade by me, to be as close to the cabinet's as possible. 

2) The cabinet art will be redone, funded by me. Inspired by, and reminescent of, the original, but not the actual art. 

3) Gameplay features. We can tweak a few things from the original game design so it's not 100% identical, but similar enough that players hopefully won't notice/care. An endless mode, online leaderboard, 6 lanes, or a different timer/phases are all possibilities. 

4) Crocodiles. Despite its many, many spinoffs, all of the NAMCO IP for this game features alligators, and NOT crocodiles. By narrowing the tip of the jaw slightly (less U-shaped, more V-shaped), and by showing the animal's bottom row of teeth when its mouth is closed, we're using a different animal still indicative of the original. 

5) Name. Clearly a game about Crocodiles should not be named "Gator Panic".
